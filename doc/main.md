# Why My Docker Place?

Because I'm that lazy.
Because sometimes I just like to click on stuff.
Because is fun to build.

# How does it work

It relies on the existence of `Makefile` on each folder, to execute the actions.
If you don't have that file, it will not know what to do.

# Current Status

This is just a Demo app. It works, but it has several design flaws.
From a certain point, it will probably be better to switch to a more "API + .js Client" approach, than this "server side" style of things. I just did it like that because it was faster.

# Future Improvements

## Big changes

- Move to an "API + .js Client" architecture.

## Small changes

- Add actions to take from the console (maybe a 1st step towards API style)

- Show the actual output of the command 

- And do it AJAX
